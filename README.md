# 🎬 Movie Recommendation & Success Prediction System
This is a mini project developed as part of the Nature Inspired Algorithms module in the final year of the BSc (Hons) in Networking & Mobile Computing program. The system includes:

🔍 A movie recommendation system using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.

🎯 A movie success predictor using a Random Forest Classifier trained on IMDb and TMDb scores, votes, and popularity.

🌐 A Flask web application to interact with both features via a user-friendly frontend.

# 🚀 Features
## Movie Recommendation
Based on title, description, and production country using TF-IDF + cosine similarity.

## Success Prediction
Predict whether a movie is likely to be a hit using a trained Random Forest model based on:

IMDb Score, IMDb Votes, TMDb Score, TMDb Popularity

## Web Interface
Built with Flask to provide:

Recommendation by movie title

Form-based success prediction using custom movie data

# 📌 Technology Stack
Python
